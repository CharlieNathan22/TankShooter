# TankShooter
A tank Shooter game I scripted in C# using Unity Engine (University Game Development Module)

## Detailed Description 

My final university module which earned me an A. I created a 3rd person shooter game where the user 
plays as an arcade tank with the ability to shoot and destroy a variety of different enemies with unique AI. There are multiple levels, basic settings, unique soundtrack
and increasingly difficult enemies including AI tanks. Power-ups scattered across the maps effect things like fire-rate and speed.
